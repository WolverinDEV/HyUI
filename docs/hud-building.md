### HUD Building

HUDs (Heads-Up Displays) in HyUI are persistent UI elements that stay on the player's screen. They are managed via the `HudBuilder`.

#### Content Sources

There are multiple ways to define the content of your HUD:

##### 1. Loading from UI Files
You can use an existing Hytale `.ui` file as the base for your HUD.

```java
HudBuilder.hudForPlayer(playerRef)
    .fromFile("Pages/MyHud.ui")
    .show(store);
```

##### 2. Loading from HYUIML (HTML)
You can define your HUD using HTML-like syntax.

```java
HudBuilder.hudForPlayer(playerRef)
    .fromHtml("<div style='anchor-top: 10; anchor-left: 10;'><p>Hello World!</p></div>")
    .show(store);
```

##### 3. Manual Building
You can manually add elements using builders.

```java
HudBuilder.hudForPlayer(playerRef)
    .addElement(LabelBuilder.label()
        .withText("Manual HUD")
        .withAnchor(new HyUIAnchor().setTop(10).setLeft(10)))
    .show(store);
```

#### Detached HUDs

Sometimes you may want to prepare a HUD configuration before you have a player reference, or reuse the same configuration for multiple players. You can use `.detachedHud()` for this.

```java
// Pre-make the HUD configuration
HudBuilder builder = HudBuilder.detachedHud()
    .fromHtml("<p>Shared HUD</p>");

// Later, show it for a specific player
builder.show(playerRef, store);
```

#### Multi-HUD System

One of the most powerful features of HyUI is the **Multi-HUD system**. 

By default, Hytale only allows a single "Custom UI HUD" to be active for a player at any given time. This usually means that if two different mods try to show a HUD, they will overwrite each other.

**HyUI takes care of this mess for you.**

When you call `.show()`, HyUI automatically checks if the player already has a HUD. If they do, and it's managed by HyUI (or a compatible "Multiple HUD" mod), it simply adds your new HUD to the existing stack. If not, it creates a `MultiHud` container that can host many independent HUD instances.

This means:
- You can have multiple independent HUD elements (e.g., a minimap, a quest tracker, and a notification bar) all running at once.
- Each HUD has its own refresh rate, its own elements, and its own event listeners.
- They won't interfere with each other or with other HyUI-based mods.
- It's completely transparent, you just build your HUD and call `.show()`, and HyUI handles the composition.

#### Running on the World Thread

When showing a HUD using `.show()`, it is **critical** to ensure that this call is made on the world thread. If you are inside an async command or another thread, you should use `world.execute()` to schedule the HUD opening.

```java
world.execute(() -> {
    HudBuilder.hudForPlayer(playerRef)
        .fromHtml("<div>Welcome!</div>")
        .show(store);
});
```

Failing to run `.show()` on the world thread will lead to an exception being thrown and the client disconnecting.

#### Periodic Refreshing

If your HUD needs to update regularly (e.g., a timer or player stats), you can set a refresh rate.

```java
HudBuilder.hudForPlayer(playerRef)
    // Refresh every 1 second
    .withRefreshRate(1000)
    .onRefresh(hud -> {
        hud.getById("timer", LabelBuilder.class).ifPresent(label -> {
            label.withText("Time: " + System.currentTimeMillis());
        });
    })
    .show(store);
```

HyUI optimizes these refreshes by batching updates for all HUDs belonging to the same player.

#### Toggling Visibility

You can hide or show specific HUD instances within the multi-hud system:

```java
// Hides the root element of this specific HUD
hud.hide();
// Shows it again
hud.unhide(); 
```

#### Removing and Re-adding

If you want to completely remove a HUD from the screen (and stop its periodic refreshes), you can use `.remove()`. You can later re-add it using `.readd()`.

```java
// Removes the HUD from the multi-hud manager
hud.remove();

// Re-adds it to the same multi-hud manager later
hud.readd();
```
