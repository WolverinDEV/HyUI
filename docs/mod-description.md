**HyUI** is a powerful, developer-friendly Java library designed to simplify the creation and management of custom User Interfaces for Hytale servers. By bridging Hytale's raw UI protocol with high-level abstractions, HyUI allows you to build complex, interactive, and high-performance UIs using either a fluent **Java Builder API** or **HYUIML**, a declarative HTML/CSS-like syntax.

Whether you are building a simple admin panel, a persistent HUD, or a full-scale RPG menu system, HyUI provides the tools and "escape hatches" needed to get the job done efficiently.

### Features

*   **HYUIML (HTML/CSS):** Build interfaces using a familiar, declarative HTML-like syntax with CSS styling.
*   **Fluent Builder API:** Construct nested UI hierarchies (Groups, Buttons, Labels, etc.) using a clean, readable chain of methods.
*   **Multi-HUD System:** Coexist with other mods effortlessly. HyUI automatically manages Hytale's single HUD slot to allow multiple independent HUD elements to be displayed simultaneously.
*   **Dynamic Element Injection:** Load base `.ui` files and inject dynamic elements into specific selectors at runtime.
*   **Event Handling Simplified:** Bind server-side logic directly to UI events using simple lambda expressions and access UI state via `UIContext`.
*   **Periodic UI Refresh:** Built-in support for batched, periodic HUD updates with low performance overhead.
*   **Specialized Builders:** Includes ready-to-use builders for:
    *   **Buttons:** Standardized game-themed text buttons and back buttons.
    *   **Input Fields:** Text, Numbers, Sliders, Checkboxes, and Color Pickers.
    *   **Containers:** Flexible Group builders with various layout modes and window frames.
    *   **Images:** Easy asset-backed images with support for Hytale's `@2x` resolution.
*   **Advanced Logic (Escape Hatches):** Access raw `UICommandBuilder` instances at any point for properties not natively covered by the API.

### Quick Start

#### 1. Installation (Gradle)

To use HyUI in your Hytale project, you can get started quickly by using the example project: [https://github.com/Elliesaur/Hytale-Example-UI-Project](https://github.com/Elliesaur/Hytale-Example-UI-Project)

Otherwise, add HyUI to your project via Cursemaven:

```gradle
repositories {
    maven { url "https://www.cursemaven.com" }
}

dependencies {
    // Project ID: 1431415
    implementation "curse.maven:hyui-1431415:<file-id>"
}
```

#### 2. Creating a Page with HYUIML (HTML)

For most use cases, HYUIML is the fastest way to build layouts:

```java
String html = """
    <div class="page-overlay">
        <div class="container" data-hyui-title="My Menu">
            <div class="container-contents">
                <p>Welcome to the menu!</p>
                <button id="myBtn">Click Me</button>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    """;

PageBuilder.pageForPlayer(playerRef)
    .fromHtml(html)
    .addEventListener("myBtn", CustomUIEventBindingType.Activating, (ctx) -> {
        playerRef.sendMessage(Message.raw("Clicked!"));
    })
    .open(store);
```

#### 3. Creating a HUD

HUDs are persistent on-screen elements:

```java
HudBuilder.hudForPlayer(playerRef)
    .fromHtml("<div style='anchor-top: 10; anchor-left: 10;'><p>Health: 100</p></div>")
    .show(store);
```
